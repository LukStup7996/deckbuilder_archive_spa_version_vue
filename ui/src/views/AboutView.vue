          <p class="form-control">
            The Deckbuilder_Archive is a private project, that aims to provide a
            simple deckbuilding application for archivers that aim to keep a
            neat record of their favourite decks. This is the Pre-Alpha
            Prototype, that mainly aims at providing a simple sandbox for
            implementing certain features in the future. As of such this version
            does not contain the full functionality of the Deckbuilder_Archive,
            but instead provides a sneak peak so to speak, of a bigger project,
            in the future.

          <p class="form-control">
            For now the functionalities will be limited to the Archive-Function,
            specifically displaying all cards in the current database. Since the
            base-functionality of these archive functions is the same,
            displaying all of them at once will display the ability to properly
            read data from a database and transform it into a decent user
            experience. It is important to note though that there are currently
            no proper filter options or deckbuilding, as well as account
            options. Their functionality has allready been programmed, but needs
            to be implemented yet.

          <h3 class="form-control">Why build the Deckbuilder_Archive?</h3>
          <p class="form-control">
            Part of my biggest hobby is finding specific pieces and making them
            work together. While it is indeed possible and probably slightly
            more professional to programm something like a booking site or an
            online store, this is a project that combines both
            base-functionalities of stores and booking sites and provides me
            personally with two advantages: First off as a Pet Project it is
            much more enticing to work on something I am deeply familiar with
            and something that brings me equivillantly much joy. That in return
            means, that this is a project that is going to see multiple
            iterrations. This is important for working in SDL-Teams, some
            projects will require ongoing support and that working incrimentally
            can be naturally expected. And secondly it allows for much more
            options and functionalities to be added. Not only are ther
            functionalities like accounts, sandboxes (which can be compared to
            item carts), archiving your own decks (compareable with placing an
            order, nut automatically), but you can create copies of existing
            decks adding them to your collections (much like favouriting a
            specific post in a CMS) and several other things.

            Well for one this is a showcase project. It is specifically designed
            to show my personal skill and progress and give potential clients
            sort of a taste of what they can expect. For another it is a project
            I dearly wish to turn into reality. As a huge nerd I like organizing
            stuff and having my very own deckbuilding tool. There are various
            well designed applications out there, that all have the very special
            touch, but I am allways missing something particular. As of such I
            have chosen this to be my pet project, I will love it, I will hate
            it and I will care for it. But it is very ambitious, it will also
            take a lot of time and will see many iterrations because of it.
